# Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier
This repository contains the code and analysis for building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used for this analysis is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
# Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
# Building the Decision Tree Classifier
The decision tree classifier was built using the sklearn library in Python. 
# Usage
To use this repository, simply clone or download the files and run the Task3.ipynb Jupyter notebook to see the decision tree classifier in action. You can also use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
